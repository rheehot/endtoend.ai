In this and the next post, we will learn about **Problem Solving**. In particular, we will be focusing on problems where its complexity comes from the amount of states the problem has. The complexity of a problem can also come from the partial observability, but we will focus on this problem later.

### What is a Problem?

For this lesson, our goal is to find a route from Arad to Bucharest. To properly define this as a **Problem**, we need to define a few components that make a problem.

![Graph from Arad to Bucharest]({{ "assets/20180424/arad_to_bucharest.png" | absolute_url }})

* Initial State $s_0$
  * This is the initial state the agent starts with. In our problem, $s_0$ is Arad.
* Actions($s$)
  * This is a function that given a state $s$, it returns a set of actions $\{a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots\}$.
* Result($s$, $a$)
  * This is a function that given a state $s$ and an action $a$, it returns a state $s'$ that is the result of applying action $a$ on state $s$.
* GoalTest($s$)
  * This is a function that returns True if $s$ is a goal state, and False otherwise. In our example, GoalTest($s$) is True only if $s$ is Bucharest.
* StepCost($s$, $a$, $s'$)
  - This is a function that returns the cost of action $a$ the moves agent from $s$ to $s'$. The step costs are written on the edges of the graph above.
* PathCost($p$)
  * This is a function that given a path $p$, it returns a cost of the path. This is the sum of the step costs of the actions in the path.

### State Space

The **State Space** is a set of all states. In our route finding problem, it contains all the cities. The state space can be categorized into three subsets.

![Division of State Space]({{ "assets/20180424/state_space.png" | absolute_url }})

The first subset is the **Frontier**. The Frontier contains the furthest states of all explored paths. The second subset is the **Explored**, the set of explored states, and the **Unexplored**, the set of states yet to be explored.

### Intro to Uninformed Search

In this lesson, we will focus on **Uninformed Search**. Uninformed search is a search strategy when we have no additional information about the states except that in the problem definition. This is different from the **Informed Search**, where we can utilize other information to find "more promising" states that explore first.

For uninformed search, We will look at **Tree Search**. The tree search can be represented by this pseudocode:

```
function Tree.Search (problem):
	frontier = { [initial] }
	loop:
		if frontier is empty: return FAIL
		path = remove.choice(frontier)
		s = path.end
		if GoalTest(s): return path
		for a in actions:
			add [path + a + s'] to frontier
```

The Tree search has different names based on which path in the frontier is chosen. We will learn Breadth First Search (BFS), Depth First Search (DFS), and Uniform Cost Search.

Note that in this Tree search algorithm, it is possible to choose an action that returns the agent back to the state that it came from. For example, we can go from Arad to Sibiu, then go from Sibiu to Arad, and explore from Arad. In most cases, we do not want this behavior. Hence, we save and update a set of explored states and  check If the new state has is already in the set of explored states before exploring it.

```
function Tree.Search (problem):
	frontier = { [initial] }
	explored = {}
	loop:
		if frontier is empty: return FAIL
		path = remove.choice(frontier)
		s = path.end; add s to explored
		if GoalTest(s): return path
		for a in actions:
			add [path + a + s'] to frontier
			unless s' in frontier or explored
```

Note when we terminate the algorithm. We did not terminate when `GoalTest(s')` holds, which is when an action took us to the goal state. Instead, we terminate when `GoalTest(s)`  holds, which is when the path to the goal state is removed from the set of frontiers. This is to ensure that the path to the goal state is the best one. We will elaborate on this when we discuss Uniform Cost Search.

### Breadth First Search (BFS)

![BFS Tree]({{ "assets/20180424/bfs_tree.png" | absolute_url }})

Also known as the Shortest First Search, the **Breadth First Search** algorithm always chooses the frontier that has the shortest edge distance from the initial state. If multiple states have same distance from the initial state, we can choose any state.

### Uniform Cost Search

Also known as the Cheapest First Search, the **Uniform Cost Search** algorithm always chooses the frontier that has the cheapest path cost. 

![Uniform Cost Search Phase 1]({{ "assets/20180424/uniform_cost_search_1.png" | absolute_url }})

In our route-finding example, in the beginning, we have three frontiers: Zerind, Sibiu, and Timisoara. Zerind has the lowest path cost of 75, so Zerind will be chosen. 

![Uniform Cost Search Phase 2]({{ "assets/20180424/uniform_cost_search_2.png" | absolute_url }})

Then, we have three frontiers: Oradea, Sibiu, and Timisoara. Timisoara has the lowest path cost of 118, so we choose Timisoara.

For Uniform Cost Search, it is essential to continue searching even when the goal state is reached. If you stop immediately after finding a path, then you cannot guarantee that it is the shortest path, since there might have been a frontier that could have reached the goal state faster.

![Uniform Cost Search Guarantee]({{ "assets/20180424/uniform_cost_search_guarantee.png" | absolute_url }})

For example, In our Arad to Bucharest example, the first path you find (Arad - Sibiu - Fagaras - Bucharest) with the uniform cost search has the cost of 460. However, there is another path (Arad - Sibiu -  Rimnicu Vilcea - Pitesti - Bucharest) that as the cost of 418. 

Therefore, you need to wait until all the other frontiers have a path cost higher than the path cost of your path to the goal state. This is ensured exactly when your path to the goal state is chosen from the list of frontiers, since by definition, uniform cost search chooses the frontier with least path cost.

### Depth First Search (DFS)

![DFS Tree]({{ "assets/20180424/dfs_tree.png" | absolute_url }})

**Depth First Search** is an algorithm where we always choose the longest path.

### Search Comparison

We can compare these 3 tree search algorithms by their properties.

 A search is **optimal** if it is guaranteed to find the shortest path, even for infinite graphs. A search is **complete** if the algorithm is guaranteed to find the goal, even for infinite graphs.
