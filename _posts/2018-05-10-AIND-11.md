In this lesson, we will learn to build an Artificial Intelligence that plays a game called Isolation better than you. We will learn the minimax algorithm, a popular algorithm for many two-player games.

### Isolation Game

**Isolation** is a two-player game played on a 5-by-5 board. For their first moves, the two players place their piece (O, X) on different places of the board. Then, the player can move the piece by moving vertically, horizontally, or diagonally across the board. However, it cannot pass the other player's piece, or places that either piece has already visited. The player who has no legal moves left loses.

### Building a Game Tree

For simplicity, let's consider a game with a smaller board. The small board is a 2-by-3 board with bottom-right corner filled in (unavailable).

Now, let's draw a **Game Tree**. Game Tree is a tree of all choices the player can make at each step.

Here is a game tree for the first two moves. The tree expands horizontally as depth increases. This continues until the game is close to the end.

### Minimax Algorithm

With this game tree, we want to know what the best move to play is. The **Minimax algorithm** is an algorithm to find the best move, assuming that the opponent is "smart" and will play its best possible move. It comes from the idea that the computer tries to *maximize* its score, while the opponent tries to *minimize* the computer's score.

To assign values to nodes in the tree, we start from the terminal node and propagate up. At each node, we look at the value of each children, and take the max or min of these values depending on whose turn it is.

### Estimating Size of Game Tree

As shown above, even with a board with 5 cells, the game tree is quite dense. If we go back to our original 5-by-5 board with 25 cells, the game tree gets even bigger. We can compute few upper bounds on the size of the game tree.

One simple upper bound for the game tree would be $25! \simeq 10^{25}$, which is the product of number of empty cells at each step.

We can improve the upper bound by noting that at any cell, there are at most 16 moves possible. Therefore, $25 \times 24 \times 16^8 \times 15!$ is a valid upper bound.

However, except for the center of the board, there are at most 12 moves possible. Therefore, in general, most nodes in the game tree (except the first two) will have at most 12 branches. This is called the **branching factor**. Therefore, $25 \times 24 \times 16 \times 12^{11} \times 11! \simeq 3 \times 10^{23}$ could be an upper bound.

A better way to estimate the size of the game tree would be by using **average branching factor**. We can estimate the average branching factor by sampling multiple games. However, the average branching factor is about 8, and $8^{25} \simeq 10^{22}$, which is still far too large for the computer to handle.

### Depth-Limited Search

Given that we have limited time, we cannot wait until the computer creates a full game tree and perform minimax on it. Therefore, we need to use **Depth-limited Search** and limit the search depth of the game tree. Given that the computer can search $10^9$ nodes, the computer can look up to depth $10$ assuming the average branching factor of 8. Since in the early game the branching factor might be higher, we will limit the computer to search to depth 9.

### Evaluation Function

With depth-limited search, the computer no longer has a full game tree. Therefore, the search might end on non-terminated board. Therefore, we need a board **evaluation function** that the computer can use to estimate the likelihood of winning on that board. A simple evaluation function could be the number of moves available to the computer.

Then, after searching until depth $d$, the computer can use the evaluation function to estimate the score of the board. It can then propagate the scores up the game tree with the minimax algorithm.
