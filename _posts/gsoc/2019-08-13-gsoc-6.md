Time flies! It's already mid-August, and I received an email about project submission guidelines for the final evaluation. Luckily, with the help of Oscar and Mandar, I was able to resolve many bugs in my implementation of Random Network Distillation!


## What's Next? {#next}

Paige, the GSoC TensorFlow organizer, offered me Google Cloud Platform credit to use for my project! As a result, my RND agent is currently training on a VM instance of GCP. After some hyperparameter tuning, I hope to share benchmarks for Atari games, notably on Venture and Montezuma's Revenge!
