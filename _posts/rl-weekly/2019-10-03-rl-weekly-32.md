excerpt: "In this issue, we look at LASER, DeepMind's improvement to V-trace that achieves state-of-the-art sample efficiency in Atari environments. We also look at Google AI and UC Berkeley's study on hierarchical RL, analyzing and isolating the reason behind the benefits of hierarchical RL in certain environments."

Dear readers,
</p>
<p>
Here is the 32nd issue! In this week's issue, there are two new algorithms that boast state-of-the-art in the Atari environment suite. There are also fascinating new frameworks, especially for robotics.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, I am going to Microsoft Research's Reinforcement Learning Day at New York today. It would be great to meet anyone who is also visiting!

**What it says**

V-trace is an importance sampling technique introduced in the IMPALA paper (Espeholt et al., 2018) for off-policy correction. It uses clipped importance sampling ratios which reduces the variance of the estimated return but introduces bias. The authors prove that this is problematic by showing that even when given an optimal value function, V-trace may not converge to a locally optimal policy. The authors suggest mixing on-policy data into the V-trace policy gradient and show that sufficient amount of online data alleviates the problem. (Section 3).

The authors also propose using trust region estimators. Off-policy learning algorithms often use multiple behavior policies to collect experience, and some of them may be unsuitable. Using importance sampling for those behavior policies may result in high or even infinite variance. Thus, the authors define a behavior relevance function and use a trust region scheme to adaptively select only suitable behavior distributions to estimate the value. (Section 4).

The authors test their algorithm LASER (LArge Scale Experience Replay) on Atari and DMLab-30 and show that it is more sample-efficient than Rainbow, Reactor, and IMPALA Meta-gradient. Interestingly, they show that prioritized experience replay did not meaningfully improve LASER's performance (Section 5.2).
