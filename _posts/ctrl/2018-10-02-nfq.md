    This paper introduces NFQ, an algorithm for efficient and effective training of a Q-value function represented by a multi-layer perceptron. Based on the principle of storing and reusing transition experiences, a model-free, neural network based RL algorithm is proposed. The method is evaluated on three benchmark problems. It is shown empirically, that reasonably few interactions with the plant are neeed to generate control policies of high quality.

## 1  Introduction

To handle real-world problems with massive scale, reinforcement Learning must be accompanied with powerful function approximation methods. Unfortunately, Boyan and Moore (1995) showed that using function approximators leads to poor convergence properties even in simple problems.
