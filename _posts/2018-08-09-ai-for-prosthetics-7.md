## Latest News

Congrats to nskiran (#1), rl_agent (#3), ymmoy999 (#4), Firework (#6), Yongjin (#8), HP (#9), and jack@NAN (#10) for getting their new agents to Top 10 this week! Read more about the current leaderboard [in the section below](#leaderboard).

I misinterpreted the transition from Round 1 to Round 2. It has been clarified that Round 1 will continue until September 16th, and once it is over, Round 2 will be held until September 30th (tentative). Round 1 is the current round where the agent needs to follow a constant horizontal velocity vector of 3 m/s. In contrast, for Round 2, the target velocity vector will be time-dependent. More information should be available soon.

Meanwhile, congratulations to the AI for Prosthetics team for getting Google Cloud Platform as a sponsor! **Top 400 teams with positive points by August 15th will be awarded $250 cloud credits.** Hope this encourages many of you to participate, since there are currently about 50 people in the leaderboard, with 34 people with positive scores!



## Leaderboard

Here are the top 10 scores for this week. A lot of new people climbed up the ladder this week, with only Mattias_Ljungström staying in the top 10 with his old agent. Only 6 of the top 10 have participated in the Learning to Run challenge, so feel free to join the competition as a newcomer!

## What's Next?

This post concludes the series of posts about the environment! I will now write about my analysis of the best agents in the last year's competition. I also hope to add a better DDPG agent, since although the `keras-rl` package is intuitive, it is slow.

I plan to keep the new [Leaderboard](#leaderboard) section so that people can see the general trend of the scores with a single chart.
