    This is a review of the paper <i>A Reduction of Imitation Learning and Structured Prediction to No-Regret Online Learning</i> by S. Ross, G. Gordon, and J. Bagnell. The paper introduces Dataset Aggregation (DAgger), an imitation learning algorithm that trains a stationary deterministic policy. DAgger is shown to outperform previous approaches in *Super Tux Kart*, *Super Mario Bros.*, and Handwriting Recognition.

With Forward Training algorithm, it is possible to achieve $T \epsilon$ guarantee by training a non-stationary policy that is a collection of policies $\pi_t$ for each timestep $t$, but this is impractical when $T$ is large.

SMILe, a recent approach, trains a stationary stochastic policy that is finite mixture of policies, adding a new policy after every training iteration. Although SMILe has better performane guarantee, the resulting policy can be unstable since the policies in the mixture can vary in quality.
