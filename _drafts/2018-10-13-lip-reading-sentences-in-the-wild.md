excerpt: >
    The goal of this work is to recognise phrases and sentences beign spoken by a talking face, with or without the audio. Unlike previous works that have focused on recognising a limited number of words and phrases, we tackle lip reading as an open world problem - unconstrained natural language sentences, and in the wild videos.
