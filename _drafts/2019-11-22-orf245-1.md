## Lecture 1: Introductory Concepts, Descriptive Statistics {#lecture-1}

In statistics, we study a **population**, a collection of well-defined objects. However, it is often implausible or impossible to measure every object in a population, so we measure a small subset of the population that we call a **sample**.

Given data, we may use statistics to summarize, understand, infer, and predict. We seek to infer properties of the population from samples. This is known as **inferential statistics**.

## Lecture 2: Probability I {#lecture-2}

To study statistics, we need to understand basic probability theory, the study of randomness or uncertainty.

An **experiment** is any activity with an uncertain outcome. A classic example of an experiment would be a coin toss.
