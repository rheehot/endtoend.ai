Reinforcement Learning is a study of an agent learning through interactions with the *environment*.  Thus, to test and compare results of different reinforcement learning algorithms, we need *testbed environments*. By far the most commonly used testbed has been 57 *Atari 2600* games. However, different environments require different exploration schemes and different algorithms. Thus, it is important to have various environments.

We attempt to provide a high-quality guide for Reinforcement Learning environments.



## OpenAI Gym

**OpenAI Gym** is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. The `gym` library is  a collection of environments that makes no assumptions about the structure of your agent. Gym comes with a diverse suite of environments, ranging from classic video games such as [Atari 2600](/envs/gym#atari-2600) and [continuous control tasks](/envs/gym#mujoco).

**The Unity Machine Learning Agents Toolkit** (ML-Agents) is an open-source Unity plugin that enables games and simulations to serve as environments for training intelligent agents.

## PySC2

**PySC2** is [DeepMind](http://deepmind.com/)'s Python component of the StarCraft II Learning Environment (SC2LE). It exposes [Blizzard Entertainment](http://blizzard.com/)'s [StarCraft II Machine Learning API](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto) as a Python RL Environment. This is a collaboration between DeepMind and Blizzard to develop StarCraft II into a rich environment for RL research. PySC2 provides an interface for RL agents to interact with StarCraft 2, getting observations and sending actions.

## PyGame Learning Environment

**PyGame Learning Environment (PLE)** is a learning environment, mimicking the [Arcade Learning Environment](https://github.com/mgbellemare/Arcade-Learning-Environment) interface, allowing a quick start to Reinforcement Learning in Python. The goal of PLE is allow practitioners to focus design of models and experiments instead of environment design.
