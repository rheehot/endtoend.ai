## Overview

<video autoplay muted loop controls>
  <source src="{{ 'assets/_pages/envs/gym/atari/jamesbond.mp4' | absolute_url }}" type="video/mp4">
</video>

The player controls the titular character of James Bond across four levels. The player is given a multi-purpose vehicle that acts as an automobile, a plane, and a submarine. The vehicle can fire shots and flare bombs, and travels from left to right as the player progresses through each level. The player can shoot or avoid enemies and obstacles that appear throughout the game, including boats, frogmen, helicopters, missiles, and mini-submarines.
