## Overview

Double Dunk is a simulation of two-on-two, half-court basketball. Teams have two on-screen characters, a shorter "outside" man and a taller "inside" man. In a single-player game, the player controls the on-screen character closest to the ball, either the one holding the ball (on offense) or the one guarding the opponent with the ball (on defense). In two-player games, each player may control one of the two teams as in a one-player game, or both players may play on the same team against a computer-controlled opponent. At the start of each possession, both offense and defense select from a number of plays (such as the "pick and roll" on offense), then attempt to score or regain possession of the ball by intercepting or stealing it from the offense.
