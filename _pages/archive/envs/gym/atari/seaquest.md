## Overview

Seaquest is an underwater shooter in which the player controls a submarine. Enemies include sharks and submarines. The player must ward off the enemies while trying to rescue divers swimming through the water. The sub can hold up to eight divers at a time. Each time the player resurfaces, all rescued divers are emptied out in exchange for points. To add to the challenge, the submarine has a limited amount of oxygen. The player must surface often in order to replenish the oxygen, but if the player resurfaces without any rescued divers, they will lose a life. If the player resurfaces with the maximum amount of divers, they will gain bonus points for the sub's remaining oxygen. Each time the player surfaces, the game's difficulty increases; enemies increase in number and speed. Eventually an enemy sub begins patrolling the surface, leaving the player without a safe haven.
