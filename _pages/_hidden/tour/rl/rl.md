title: A Tour of Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning is a subfield of Machine Learning where agents learn by interacting with the environment. Leading groups such as Google DeepMind and OpenAI have used Reinforcement Learning to achieve superhuman levels in many tasks, the most famous one being AlphaGo defeating Lee Sedol.

Because Reinforcement Learning is an emerging field, there are not too many textbooks on the topic. Fortunately, *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction* written by Sutton and Barto is one of the few great textbooks introducing readers to the topic.
