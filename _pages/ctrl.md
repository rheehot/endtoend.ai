    Read summaries of new papers in Reinforcement Learning, ranging from
    theoretical studies to experiments.
---

Reinforcement Learning is a blooming field with interesting papers being published every day. Unfortunately, the sheer amount of new papers can be overwhelming for those that cannot follow all these new papers on a daily basis. **CTRL** hopes to assist these people in two ways:

1. Help people follow emerging trends without devoting too much time
2. Help people decide what papers to read

CTRL summarizes the ideas and results of a paper and puts it into context by connecting it to other relevant papers. In a sense, it can be seen as an extended abstract, but with more visualizations and context.
