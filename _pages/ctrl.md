    Read summaries of new papers in Reinforcement Learning, ranging from
    theoretical studies to experiments.

Reinforcement Learning is a blooming field with interesting papers being published every day. Unfortunately,This can be overwhelming for those without the time to read new papers on a daily basis. **CTRL** hopes to serve two goals:

1. Help people follow emerging trends without devoting too much time
2. Help people decide what papers to read

CTRL is a page summarizing the ideas and results of recent papers. In a sense, it can be seen as an extended abstract, but with more visualizations and context.
