### Representing N Queens

To learn Genetic Algorithms, we will use the N Queens problem. We will encode the board state with $N$ numbers, denoting the row position of the queen on each column.

### Fitness Function

For $N$ queens, there are ${N \choose 2} = \frac{N(N - 1)}{2}$ pairs of queens, so there can be at most $\frac{N (N - 1)}{2}$ attacks in any position of $N$-Queens problem. When $N = 8$, ${N \choose 2} = 28$. Therefore, we can use a fitness function $E = 28 - \text{# of attacks}$, and we found an optimal solution when $E = 28$.

### Genetic Algorithm: Breeding

Genetic Algorithms is an iterative improvement algorithm analogous to natural selection in biology. It uses **breeding** and **mutation** to find the optimal solution.

**Breeding** is a step of using "parent" boards to create new "child" boards. Suppose we have 4 boards as our "gene pool" for the N-Queens problem. We evaluate the objective function for all 4 boards, and we choose another set of 4 boards. We weigh the choice by the objective function, so if $E(\text{Board 1}) = 2$ and $E(\text{Board 2}) = 1$, then Board 1 would have twice the chance of getting picked compared to Board 2. Note that we can choose the same board multiple times.

The four boards we selected will act as "parents" of the next boards. For convenience, each set of parents will produce two child boards. (The number of children per parents is a parameter.)

We create the child boards through a **Crossover process**. We divide the parent boards by randomly selecting a division point. Then, we stitch the divided parts to create new child boards.

### Genetic Algorithm: Mutation

Although breeding can combine parent boards and generate good board positions, it is also possible that the key component of the optimal solution might not be in any parent board, or that that parent board never gets selected. Therefore, we add the **mutation step** to bring more randomness to the process. For each digit, we give a small chance for it to mutate into some random digit.
