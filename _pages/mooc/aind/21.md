### Dynamic Time Warping

Suppose we want to identify dolphins by their whistles. (This is useful marine mammal researchers) The whistles can be warped in time differently: a whistle by the same dolphin could be faster or slower. Also, the dolphins might change the frequency of the whistle. The distinguishing feature of dolphin whistles seem to be the pattern of rises and falls. 

First, let's solve the issue of frequency by using $\Delta$ frequency: the difference of frequency from the previous time step.

We can also solve the issue of elongated or shortened whistles with **dynamic time warping**. Dynamic time warping is a method of aligning two whistles so that they best match up.

First, we write the delta frequencies of the two whistles we want to compare. For convenience, let's denote the delta frequency of two whistles $x_1, \ldots, x_m$ and $y_1, \ldots, y_n$.

We start with the first sample of each whistle: $x_1=0$ and $y_1=0$. We add a point to $(x_1, y_1)$ to the plot. Then, we look at the next samples $x_2, y_2$ and see if $x_2$ is closer to $y_1$ or $y_2$. In this case, $y_2 = 5$, so $x_2$ is closer to $y_1$, so we add a point $(x_2, y_1)$ to the plot. In case there is a tie, we draw a diagonal from $(x_1, y_1)$ to $(x_m, y_n)$ and use the point closer to the diagonal.

You must match $x_m$ and $y_n$, the two ends of the whistles.

Now, we calculate the distance of two whistles by adding all squared errors of each pair of samples and taking the square root.

The problem with dynamic time warping is that it could by allowing any amount of warping, we give low distance to very different whistles. To solve this, we use **Sakoe Chiba Bounds**: which is a bound on the maximum warping possible. The bounds are often calculated empirically.
