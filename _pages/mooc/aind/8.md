### Classical Planning

**Classical Planning** is a representation language for states, actions and plans. It factors the world into variables to solve complex problems. 

First, let's see how state is represented in classical planning. In classical planning, a **state space** consists of all possible assignments of $k$ boolean variables. Then, the **world state** is a complete assignment of these variables, and a **belief state** is a complete or partial assignment of the variables or an arbitrary formula, dependent on the environment.

For example, in the Vacuum World above, states would be represented the following way:

| Classical Planning | Vacuum World                                                |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **State Space**    | $2^3=8$ of $3$ Boolean variables (*DirtA*, *DirtB*, *VacA*) |
| **World State**    | Complete assignment of $3$ booleans                         |
| **Belief State**   | Partial assignment of $3$ booleans                          |

The actions are represented with an **action schema**. The schema makes it able to represent multiple similar actions succinctly even in large worlds. The schema contains three parts: the action, the preconditions, and the effects.

* The **action** is the action that the agent will take.
* The **preconditions** of an action are conditions that must be satisfied for the action to be executed.
* The **effects** of an action are the results of taking the action.

Let's use an example to clarify ths concept. Suppose that we want to send cargo around the world with planes. One action in this world is to fly a plane $p$ from one location $x$ to another location $y$. This action can be written as $\text{Fly}(p, x, y)$. 

For $p$ to fly from $x$ to $y$, we need to verify a few things. Obviously, the objects $x$ and $y$ should be an airport and $p$ should be a plane. Also, the plane $p$ should be at $x$. These are the preconditions of the action $\text{Fly}(p, x, y)$. This is the precondition of the action.

After the action, the plane $p$, is no longer at $x$ but at $y$. This is the effect of the action.

| Classical Planning | Air Cargo Transport                                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Action             | $\text{Fly}(p, x, y)$                                        |
| Precondition       | $\text{Plane}(p) \land \text{Airport}(x) \land \text{Airport}(y) \land \text{At}(p, x)$ |
| Effect             | $\lnot \text{At}(p, x) \land \text{At}(p, y)$                |

Here is a full Action schema for the Air Cargo Transport example:

###Progression Search

![Diagram of Progression Search]({{ "assets/mooc/aind/8/progression_search_diagram.png" | absolute_url }})

Now we know the how states and actions are represented. The simplest way to plan withe these representations is to use **Progression Search**. As the name hints, this is a simple graph search algorithm, searching from the initial state trying all actions until we find a goal state.

### Regression Search

Another way to search is to start from the goal. This is called the **Regression Search**. As the name suggests, we start from the goal and search backwards.

![Diagram of Regression Search]({{ "assets/mooc/aind/8/regression_search_diagram.png" | absolute_url }})

To search backwards, we need to look at all actions and check which actions can result in a goal. In the Air Cargo Transport example, one of the requirements of a goal is $\text{At}(C_1, \text{JFK})$, and the only action schema that adds an $\text{At}$ is the *Unload* schema.

![Unload action schema]({{ "assets/mooc/aind/8/unload_schema.png" | absolute_url }})

Therefore, $\text{Unload}(C, P, \text{JFK})$ would add $\text{At}(C_1, \text{JFK})$. We can now move one step back. We continue this search until we find the initial state.

### Regression vs Progression

Regression search is more complicated than Progression search, but it is dramatically faster in some cases. When there are many possible actions, but only few lead to a goal, regression search performs better.

![Regression vs Progression Diagram]({{ "assets/mooc/aind/8/regression_vs_progression.png" | absolute_url }})

Here is a simple example. We want to buy a book, and we have an action schema $\text{Buy}(b)$ that buys a book if given an ISBN. Then, there are millions of actions, one for each ISBN, so it takes a long time for the progression search to find the correct action. However, the regression search can find the action instantaneously since there is only one action that leads to the goal.
