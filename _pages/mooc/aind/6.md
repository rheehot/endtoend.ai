### First Order Logic from Natural Language

**First Order Logic** is based on the declarative semantics of Propositional Logic. However, it is more expressive by adopting representative ideas from natural language (ex. English).

- **Objects** refer to the nouns of natural languages.
  - people, houses, numbers, theories, Ronald McDonald, colors, baseball games, wars, centuries, ...
- **Relations** refer to the verbs of natural languages.
  - Unary relations are called **Properties**: red, round, bogus, ...
  - Relations can also be $n$-ary: brother of, bigger than, inside.
- **Functions** are relations where one object maps to only one object.
  - one more than, beginning of, ...

### Elements of First Order Logic

Let us use an example to understand the models in First Order Logic. The world in First Order Logic consists of a set of objects and symbols that stand for objects, relations and functions.

![Example of a First Order Logic World]({{ "assets/mooc/aind/6/fol_example.png" | absolute_url }})

In the example above, the objects are Richard the Lionheart, King John, Richard the Lionheart's left leg, King John's left leg, and the crown. 

There are **constant symbols** that refer to objects. Note that multiple constants can refer to same object, and that some object may not have a constant. In our world, we have two constants: *Richard* and *John*.

There are also **predicate symbols** that refer to relations. In our world, we have two binary predicate symbols *Brother, OnHead* and two unary predicate symbols *Person, King, Crown*.

Finally, there are **function symbols** that refer to functions. In our world, we have one function symbol *LeftLeg*.

| Symbols           | Example                                                      |
| :---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Constant symbols  | *Richard*, *John*                                            |
| Predicate symbols | *Brother(x, y)*, *OnHead(x, y)*, *Person(x)*, *King(x)*, *Crown(x)* |
| Function symbols  | *LeftLeg(x)*                                                 |

### First Order Logic Model

A model in First Order Logic consists of an **interpretation** for all the symbols in the world. Here is one interpretation that would be called the **intended interpretation**:

![Example of a First Order Logic Model]({{ "assets/mooc/aind/6/fol_example.png" | absolute_url }})

In this interpretation, the constant *Richard* refers to the object Richard the Lionheart and the constant  *John* refers to the object King John. The binary predicate symbol *Brother* refers to the brotherhood relation. *OnHead* refers to the "on head" relation of the crown and King John. Unary relations *Person*, *King*, *Crown* refer to objects that are persons, kings, and crowns respectively. Finally, *LeftLeg* refers to the mapping of Richard the Lionheart and King John to their left legs.

However, many different interpretations are possible. For example, in some model *Richard* and *John* could both refer to the crown, and the statement *LeftLeg(Richard) = John* might be true. In First Order Logic, the number of possible models is enormous and often unbounded, so it is impossible to check all possible models like we did in Propositional Logic using truth tables.

### First Order Logic Syntax

A **term** is a logical expression that refers to an object. By definition, all constant symbols are terms. However, some objects have no constant symbols and can only be referred by function symbols. For example, in the intended interpretation, there is no constant referring to King John's left leg, but it can be referred as *LeftLeg(John)*.

First Order Logic also have **atomic sentences** or **atoms** that describe facts. Atomic sentences are formed by a predicate symbol  and a parenthesized list of terms such as *Brother(Richard, John)* or *OnHead(LeftLeg(Richard), John)*. An atomic sentence is **true** in a model if the relation holds. In the model with intended interpretation, *Brother(Richard, John)* is true but *OnHead(LeftLeg(Richard), John)* is not.

We can use more complex sentences using **logical connectives**. The same logical connectives $\land, \lor, \lnot, \to$ is also used in First Order Logic.

First Order Logic has collections of objects, so to utilize these collections, we use **quantifiers**. There are two quantifiers: the universal quantifier $\forall$ and the existential quantifier $\exists$.

The **universal quantifier** $\forall$ is usually pronounced "for all ...", and is used to express general rules. $\forall x \; P$ is an expression that is true when $P$ is true for all object $x$. For example, $\forall x \; King(x) \to Person(x)$ translates to "For all $x$, if $x$ is a King, then $x$ is a Person". If the intended interpretation, this statement is true.

The **existential quantifier** $\exists$ is usually pronounced "there exists ..." and is used to express that there exists some object that satisfies some sentence. $\exists x \; P$ holds when there exists some object $x$ such that $P$ holds. For example, in the intended interpretation, $\exists x \; Crown(x) \land OnHead(x, John)$ is true, but $\exists x \; Person(x) \land LeftLeg(x)$ is not.


### Comparison of Languages

Now that we learned Propositional Logic and First Order Logic, let's compare them with Probability Theory.

First ,we can compare them by their **Ontological Commitments**, which is how the logic describes the world. Unlike in Propositional Logic and Probability Theory, in First Order Logic we have **Objects** (people, animals, houses), **Relations** (brother, bigger than), and **Functions** (father of, roof of).

|                         | Ontological Commitments              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **First Order Logic**   | Facts, Relations, Objects, Functions |
| **Propositional Logic** | Facts                                |
| **Probability Theory**  | Facts                                |

We can also compare them by their **Epistemological Commitments**, which is the types of beliefs the agents can have. Similar to Propositional Logic, in First Order Logic, the agent can believe that the statement is True, False, or Unknown.

|                         | Epistemological Commitments |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **First Order Logic**   | True or False or Unknown    |
| **Propositional Logic** | True or False or Unknown    |
| **Probability Theory**  | [0, 1]                      |

Finally, we can also compare them by their **State Representations**.

|                         | **State Representations** |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **First Order Logic**   | Structured                |
| **Propositional Logic** | Factored                  |
| **Probability Theory**  | Factored                  |

The representation of the state can be Atomic, Factored or Structured. **Atomic** representation of states have states without any components. We used it for Search and Problem Solving. There were no internal structure in the states, and we only checked equality of states or whether the state is a goal state. **Factored** representation of states is a representations of states where states are factored into variables. In Propositional logic, the variables is booleans. In **Structured** representation, an individual state can include relationships between objects. First Order Logic has a structured state representation since it has relations between objects.
