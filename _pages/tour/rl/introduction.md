Reinforcement Learning is a computational approach to interaction-based learning. When you are learning how to walk, you are not told by anyone how much force to apply to each of your muscle. Instead, you repeatedly try to walk, and learn how to walk by favoring actions that helped you take a step and avoiding actions that led you to fall.

Reinforcement Learning is different from both supervised learning and unsupervised learning. In supervised learning, the learner is given a *training set* amassed by the supervisor. In contrary, in reinforcement learning, the *learner* is not given any information about the best behavior. Instead, the learner receives a positive or negative reward based on the actions it took and learns by correlating the actions it took with the rewards it received.
