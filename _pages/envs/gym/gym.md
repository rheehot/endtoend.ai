OpenAI Gym is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms.Â The `gym` library is  a collection of environments that makes no assumptions about the structure of your agent. Gym comes with a diverse suite of environments, ranging from [classic video games](#atari-2600) and [continuous control tasks](#mujoco).

## Atari 2600

**Atari 2600** is a video game console from Atari released on 1977. The game console includes popular games such as *Breakout*, *Ms. Pacman* and *Space Invaders*. Since Deep Q-Networks were introduced by Mnih et al. in 2013, Atari 2600 has been the standard environment to test new Reinforcement Learning algorithms. Atari 2600 has been a challenging testbed due to its high-dimensional video input (size 210 x 160, frequency 60 Hz) and the discrepancy of tasks between games.
