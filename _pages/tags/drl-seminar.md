**Deep RL Seminar** is a weekly seminar I have organized to survey the vast field of deep reinforcement learning with 11 participants. It is for those who have a solid background in reinforcement learning (RL) and some understanding of deep RL that want to survey the subfields of deep RL.

**Prerequisities**

- A thorough understanding of [Deep Q-Network (DQN)](https://deepmind.com/research/dqn/) and [vanilla Policy Gradient](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/1713-policy-gradient-methods-for-reinforcement-learning-with-function-approximation.pdf).
- A basic understanding of [Rainbow (DQN)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02298) and policy gradient methods up to [Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347).

**Goals**

- Survey the subfields of Deep RL
- Understand the progress of each subfield
- Find what limitations current state of the art algorithms have
- Discuss what improvements could be made to overcome such limitations
