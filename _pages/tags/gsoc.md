[Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) is a global program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development. Students work with an open source organization on a 3 month programming project during their break from school.

My project proposal [**Adding Curiosity to TF-Agents**](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4814181524570112) to work on TensorFlow for GSoC 2019 have been accepted, and I will work on improving their reinforcement learning library TF-Agents for the summer of 2019. I will implement pseudocount-based exploration via Context Tree Switching (CTS), Intrinsic Curiosity Module (ICM), and Random Network Distillation (RND).

I will be mentored by [Oscar Ramirez](https://ai.google/research/people/OscarRamirez) who is a researcher at Google Brain Robotics Team, and [Mandar Sanjay Deshpande](https://mandroid6.github.io/), who is a machine learning developer at Citi.
